\subsection{Thoughts on tuning VP}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Higher $R_1$ Less landmarks
    \item Trust odometry to much causes predicted position to change making it harder to make associations
    \item Too large R, we overfit and NIS becomes small
    \item Avoid detecting same object as different
\end{itemize}

\section{Consistency}

\subsection{Fit to GNSS}

One way of showing a fit between the GNSS data and the estimated 
positions is to attempt a translation of the GNSS data onto the estimates
and analyse the error. We found the rotation using SVD and the translation
was found by solving a linear least squares problem.
